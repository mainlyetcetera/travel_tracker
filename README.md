# Travel Tracker

### What is it?

This is a practice repo. Students practice making api calls and using the corresponding data.
Students also gain experience with **Webpack** and building a modular file structure.

### Why does it exist?

- make api calls using `fetch` and `.then()` syntax
- use data stored in promises to influence a data-model
- have a DOM that properly displays the data from that data-model
- practice building a modular file structure linked with **Webpack**
